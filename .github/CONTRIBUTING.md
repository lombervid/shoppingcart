## Creating issues

### Bug reports

Always try to provide as much information as possible. If you are reporting a bug, try to provide a repro or a stacktrace at the very least. This will help us check the problem quicker.

### Feature requests

Lay out the reasoning behind it and propose an API for it. Ideally, you should have a practical example to prove the utility of the feature you're requesting.
